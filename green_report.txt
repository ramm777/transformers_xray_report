Row 0:

reference: Interstitial opacities without changes.

predictions: Interstitial opacities at bases without changes.

green_analysis: 
The candidate report specifies the location of the interstitial opacities as "at bases", which is not mentioned in the reference report. This could be considered a clinically insignificant error as it does not change the overall diagnosis or treatment plan, but it is an additional detail not present in the reference report.

Row 1:

reference: Interval development of segmental heterogeneous airspace opacities throughout the lungs . No significant pneumothorax or pleural effusion . Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are scattered throughout the lungs . The heart is not significantly enlarged .

predictions: Interval development of segmental heterogeneous airspace opacities throughout the lungs . No significant pneumothorax or pleural effusion . Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are scattered throughout the lungs . The heart is not significantly enlarged .

green_analysis: 
The candidate report is identical to the reference report. There are no discrepancies in the findings, their anatomic locations, severity, or comparisons. Therefore, there are no errors, either clinically significant or insignificant.

[Clinically Significant Errors]:
(a) False report of a finding in the candidate: 0.

Row 2:

reference: Lung volumes are low, causing bronchovascular crowding. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax detected. Within the limitations of chest radiography, osseous structures are unremarkable.

predictions: Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been removed. Changes of median sternotomy, with continued leftward displacement of the fourth inferiomost sternal wire. There is continued moderate-to-severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Pulmonary aeration is slightly improved, with residual left lower lobe atelectasis. Stable central venous congestion and interstitial pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.

green_analysis: 
The candidate report has several discrepancies when compared to the reference report. The candidate report mentions the removal of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes, changes of median sternotomy, enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, left lower lobe atelectasis, central venous congestion, interstitial pulmonary edema, and small bilateral pleural effusions. None of these findings are mentioned in the reference report. The reference report mentions low lung volumes causing bronchovascular crowding, an unremarkable cardiomediastinal silhouette, and no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. None of these findings are mentioned in the candidate report.

[Clinically Significant Errors]:
(a) False report of a finding in the candidate: 7. Removal of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes; Changes of median sternotomy; Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette; Left lower lobe atelectasis; Central venous congestion; Interstitial pulmonary edema; Small bilateral pleural effusions.
(b) Missing a finding present in the reference: 3. Low lung volumes causing bronchovascular crowding; Unremarkable cardiomediastinal silhouette; No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
(c) Misidentification of a finding's anatomic location/position: 0.
(d) Misassessment of the severity of a finding: 0.
(e) Mentioning a comparison that isn't in the reference: 0.
